# Data Structures Course Project: Simple Task Manager

## Overview
This project aims to blend theoretical knowledge of data structures with practical software development skills by creating a task management system akin to Jira. Students are tasked with designing and implementing their own data structures to handle different aspects of task management efficiently.

## Features
- **User Management**: Functions such as register, login, and manage user profiles.
- **Task Management**: Includes capabilities to create, update, delete, and search for tasks.
- **Project Boards**: Organize tasks within customizable projects and boards.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Implement different permissions based on user roles such as Admin, Manager, and User.

## Data Structures
Students are required to implement the following data structures from scratch and integrate them into their application:
- **Stack**: Used for managing undo operations in task edits.
- **Queue**: Handle notifications and task processing queues.
- **Linked List**: Maintain dynamic lists of tasks and projects.
- **Binary Tree**: Enhance the efficiency of search operations.
- **Hash Table**: Used for fast mapping of user IDs to user details and task IDs to tasks.

## Technical Requirements
- **Backend**: Students may choose any programming language (e.g., Python, Java, Node.js).
- **Frontend**: A graphical user interface (GUI) must be developed. Frameworks like React, Angular, or even simpler ones like Tkinter for Python can be used.
- **Database**: Students are free to choose any relational or NoSQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Install the chosen programming language and setup the selected database on your local machine.

### Installation
1. Create an organization for your team in github.

2. Create a repository in your organization and add at least one TAs to your repository.

3. Start your project implemention and commit each changes in git. 
HINT: Your commits will be checked and has a part of your score.


## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains all source files for backend and frontend implementations.
- `db/`: Database scripts, schemas, and connection configurations.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation and detailed project specifications.
- `tests/`: Test scripts for unit and integration testing.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Effective implementation and use of the specified data with the database, programming language, and GUI choices.
- Functionality and usability of the GUI in task and user management.
- Code quality, documentation, and error handling.

## Appendix
- Additional instructions on data structure applications and GUI development best practices will be provided in supplementary documents.
